Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Update [`extractExports`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\") Function**:\n   - Modify the [`extractExports`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\") function to recognize and handle different types of exports.\n   - Ensure it can extract and return details about functions, classes, objects, arrays, booleans, and other types.\n\n2. **Update Plugin Logic**:\n   - Adjust the logic in the [`GoogleAppsScriptExportsPlugin`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\") to process the extracted export details correctly.\n   - Ensure that the plugin can write these exports to the [`exportsPath`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\") file in a format that preserves their types.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. **Update [`extractExports`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\")**:\n   - Traverse the AST and identify different types of exports.\n   - Collect details about each export type (e.g., functions, classes, objects, arrays, booleans).\n\n2. **Update [`GoogleAppsScriptExportsPlugin`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\")**:\n   - Process the export details and write them to the [`exportsPath`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwildhog%2FDocuments%2Fclients%2F_ownProjects%2Fconsolas%2Fvite-plugin%2Fvite-plugin-appsscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22282cbd61-c87c-413b-92d4-4d845f73a2ca%22%5D \"Go to definition\") file.\n   -
